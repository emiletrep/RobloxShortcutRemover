# No more Roblox Shortcuts
If you're like me, your desktop welcomes you everyday. A meticulous arrangement of files and folders on a beautiful image of your choosing. But then, who likes to have a cluttered desktop filled with shortcuts appearing every couple days? Most software have the decency to not create desktop shortcuts without asking you, but this isn't the case for Roblox. They audaciously add their strikingly shiny and colorful icons on your desktop every update, often more than once a week.

This is a background app that removes `Roblox Player.lk` and `Roblox Studio.lk` when they appear.

## Instructions
- Download the latest release.
- If you want to put it in your starter programs:
  - Press `Windows + R` to bring up Run dialog.
  - Run `shell:startup` to open your startup folder
  - Drag the exe file in there.

If needed, you can find and terminate it with the Task Manager (`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`)
